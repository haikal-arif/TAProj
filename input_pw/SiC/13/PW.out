     WARNING: the MGGA functional with ID    5 has been 
     read together with other dft terms, but it should 
     stand alone in order to work properly. The other 
     terms will be ignored.

     hartree contribution      =       3.15683655 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -5.12507015 Ry
     ewald contribution        =     -15.70924431 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  35 iterations
