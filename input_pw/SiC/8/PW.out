     WARNING: the MGGA functional with ID    5 has been 
     read together with other dft terms, but it should 
     stand alone in order to work properly. The other 
     terms will be ignored.

!    total energy              =     -19.27820788 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.00000068 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =       4.17258018 Ry
     hartree contribution      =       2.46343276 Ry
