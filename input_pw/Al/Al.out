     WARNING: the MGGA functional with ID    5 has been 
     read together with other dft terms, but it should 
     stand alone in order to work properly. The other 
     terms will be ignored.

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
